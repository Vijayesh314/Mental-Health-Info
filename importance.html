    <h2>Understanding Mental Health</h2>
    <p>Mental health refers to our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act, influencing every aspect of our lives.</p>
    <h2>Why Mental Health Matters</h2>
    <p>Here are several reasons why prioritizing mental health is essential:</p>
    <ul>

        <li><strong>Physical Health:</strong> Mental health and physical health are interconnected. Poor mental health can negatively impact physical health, leading to issues such as high blood pressure, heart disease, and weakened immune system.</li>
        <li><strong>Productivity:</strong> Mental well-being is crucial for productivity and performance. When we are mentally healthy, we can think clearly, focus effectively, and maintain motivation, leading to better performance in work, school, and other areas of life.</li>

        <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> Mental health resilience is the ability to adapt to adversity, trauma, or significant stress. It allows us to bounce back from setbacks, learn from experiences, and grow stronger in the face of challenges.</li>
    </ul>
